~~~~~~~~Main Menu~~~~~~~~
Agents  Maps  Utilities  Roles

~~~~~~~~Case Maps~~~~~~~~
(Maps)  ->  (Pick map)  _Gimic_  -any>  Recommended_comp

(Recommended_comp)  ->  Case Agents/Pick agent

~~~~~~~~Case Agents~~~~~~~~
(Agents)  ->  _Agent count_  Pick agent  -any>  Best_played_on  Plays_role  Utilities

(Best_played_on)  ->  Case Maps/Pick map
(Fits_role)  ->  Case Roles/Pick role
(Utilities)  -> Case Utilities/Pick util

~~~~~~~~Case Utilities~~~~~~~~
(Utilities)  _Average agent util_  _Most used, least used util_  ->  Pick utility  -any>  Case Agents

(Roles)  ->  For every pick role | _Num of agents_ | _Avg util_ ->  _Description_ _Average util_  Plays_role

(Plays_role)  ->  Phoenix, Sova, etc...  ->  Case Agents


~~~~~~~~MYSQL Plan~~~~~~~~
1. Sum(agents.agent_name)
2. Join Agents, Recommended_comp and maps
3. Join Agents, Roles and fits
4. Join Agents, Utilities
* Aggregates -> _Count_, AverageGroup, _CountGroup_

* Basically, each page usually gives you results that are also buttons to continue, with potential to loop.
* This is for patch 2.04, and as game is updated these stats will change, very flexible
* New char -> add to agents, new map -> add to maps and add comp, meta change -> change comps
