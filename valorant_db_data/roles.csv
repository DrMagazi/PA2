entry-fragger,"the entry fragger is the first to enter an objective or area for the team. entry fraggers are able to make a play and take in information as quickly as possible. typically, entry fraggers are confident in their ability to land the shot and aren't afraid of taking one. they may not normally be the most lethal members of a team, but they are the ones putting a team's strategy into action by providing information. entry fraggers are often the first to fall, but they turn the igl’s calls from theory into action. they are given the least chance of success, but when they do succeed, the team thrives."
playmaker,"the playmaker typically follows behind the entry fragger and has the same objectives. playmakers are able to take in the information provided and claim return kills or territory after the entry fragger is taken out. a playmaker is usually one of your team’s better shots and tends to clutch when needed. if played correctly, playmakers create big moments."
support,"the support is the master of grenades and angles. supports provide space for entry fraggers or snipers via grenades or well-placed defensive cover fire. strong knowledge of walls, grenades, and maps is incredibly important to supports, as they need to know where and when the enemy might push or lay low in order to exploit these positions. supports tend to stay calm and collected for the team and provide aid via tacticals and other abilities. supports are incredibly powerful in objective control and create difficulty for enemies pushing in."
igl,"the igl is the one-voice-for-all and overall strategy communicator for the team. igls are more focused on the map and positioning of their teammates over their own. as each round can shift the ebb and flow of control in a match, it's up to the igl to assess and articulate what the team needs to do to win. similar to the support role, this player will provide information and position-calling for the team, as well as grenades to safely get them where they need to go."
sniper,"the sniper is all about the angles and holding long lanes on the map. it is crucial for snipers to position according to the team's strategy and positioning when approaching and defending objectives. having the ability to one-hit from afar can set your team up for a breach on an objective or allow your team to feel confident to begin your push while halting an opponent’s. snipers can grant an immediate early-game advantage if they’re able to get the first frag via a snipe, and can confidently lock down positioning around objectives in the mid-game. the sniper moves and responds to where the igl commands and is a key fixture in executing plans."
lurker,"the lurker is the ear of the team and one who isn’t afraid to be a lone wolf in an attempt to catch a win. lurkers are all about map and game knowledge, using both to slowly move around the map and provide information on the enemy team. lurkers live in their own lane, taking a different path or direction from the team. they have no problem showing up in the last few seconds of a round from unexpected areas to surprise the enemy with a flank and clutch out a round. other than igls, lurkers are the only players who may be more deadly with what they are saying and hearing than what they are shooting."
